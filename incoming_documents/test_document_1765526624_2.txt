Irrevocable Burial Trust Account, revised October 2014
All funds received shall be placed in an interest bearing account with Longwood Funeral Home of Matthew

with his/her name and Social Security number attached.
Longwood Funeral Home of Matthew Genereux, Inc., guarantees that the consumer will pay no more for initially

will be responsible for the additional balance.
At the appropriate time, Longwood Funeral Home of Matthew Genereux, Inc., will perform the services agreed
upon and provide the merchandise selected. Longwood Funeral Home of Matthew Genereux will prepare a
statement with current prices. Longwood Funeral Home of Matthew Genereux, Inc., shall be paid in full from the

cash accommodation items have increased at the interest rate of the pre-paid account, there will be no additional
funds paid to Longwood Funeral Home of Matthew Genereux, Inc. However, if changes have been made in the
services desired or merchandise selected an understanding will have to be reached between the family of the
deceased and Longwood Funeral Home of Matthew Genereux, Inc. It shall be the Trustor's responsibility to
provide the required certified copy of death needed to release the pre-paid funds.
