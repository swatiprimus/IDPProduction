BATCH PAGE PROCESSING + PARALLEL LLM CALLS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

WHAT WILL THESE STEPS DO?
================================================================================

Batch Page Processing:
  - Instead of sending 1 page per LLM call, send 2-3 pages together
  - Reduces LLM calls from 10 to 5 (50% fewer)
  - Reduces cost from $0.155 to $0.0775 per document (50% cheaper)
  - Reduces processing time from 50s to 25s (50% faster)

Parallel LLM Calls:
  - Instead of waiting for each LLM call to complete, send multiple calls simultaneously
  - Reduces processing time from 50s to 20s (60% faster)
  - Maintains same cost ($0.155 per document)
  - Better resource utilization

Combined (Batch + Parallel):
  - Reduces LLM calls from 10 to 5 (50% fewer)
  - Reduces cost from $0.155 to $0.0775 per document (50% cheaper)
  - Reduces processing time from 50s to 10s (80% faster)
  - Increases throughput from 72 to 360 docs/hour (5x more)
